## Activities

### GoBadge Hacking

If you are one of the very fortunate individuals to have received a GoBadge, it is in fact yours to keep!

Go to https://github.com/tinygo-org/gobadge for more info.

### TinyGo IoT sensors

We have some Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect IoT microcontroller boards for each person to use for the activity.

https://store.arduino.cc/collections/boards/products/arduino-nano-rp2040-connect

These can be programmed using TinyGo.

There are 15 Grove sensor kits that you can use for the activity.

Ready to try this out? Go to [./sensor/arduino/](./sensor/arduino/) to get started.

### Gopherdrones

#### DJI Tello

We have three Parrot Minidrones you can fly with Go code to control them using their built-in Bluetooth API.

Post in-flight videos using hashtag #gophercon

Ready for takeoff? Go to [./drone/minidrone/](./drone/minidrone/).

### Gopherbot

We have four Gopherbots for everyone to take turns playing with.

Gopherbot is a robotic gopher plushie that can be programmed using TinyGo.

Check out https://github.com/hybridgroup/gopherbot for more info.

### TinyGo Music Jam

Make your own electronic musical instruments using TinyGo and the Raspberry Pi Nano boards.

Thanks to the USB-MIDI support, you can turn your board into a tiny digital musical instrument controller.

Add buttons, sliders, a joystick, and when we say become part of the music we mean it!

Let's make beautiful music together, just go to [./musicjam/](./musicjam/).

### Sphero Ollie robots

Turns out we had a few unopened Sphero Ollie robots that we found just in time for Gophercon! These fast Bluetooth controlled robotic toys have long been a Go programmer fan favorite.

There are 4 Sphero Ollie robots to help satisfy your need for speed.

Want to take one for a spin? Go to [./robot/sphero/](./robot/sphero/).
